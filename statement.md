## 📝 Problem Statement: Laundry Management System

This project addresses the challenges faced by student hostels, residential colleges, and small-scale laundry services that rely on **manual, paper-based, or non-integrated systems** to manage laundry orders.

### 🎯 Core Issues Addressed:

1.  **Inefficiency and Errors in Record Keeping:** Manual records are prone to **human error**, misplacement, and illegibility, making accurate tracking difficult and time-consuming.
2.  **Difficulty in Tracking and Retrieval:** Without a centralized, searchable system, finding a specific student's order for pick-up or checking historical charges is slow, leading to **poor customer service** and operational delays.
3.  **Inconsistent and Slow Billing/Cost Calculation:** Manual calculation of the total cost (due to varying prices for shirts, jeans, bedsheets, etc.) is prone to errors, which can result in **disputes** or lost revenue.
4.  **Lack of Data Persistence:** Physical or simple digital records can be lost or damaged, leading to a complete loss of order history and accountability.

### 💡 Proposed Solution

The **Laundry Management System** is a command-line interface (CLI) application that provides a **simple, persistent, and centralized digital platform** to digitize and streamline the core workflow.

* **Key Function:** Automatically calculates the total cost, standardizes order data entry (Roll No., Name, Items), and ensures rapid searching and retrieval of records.
* **Persistence:** Data is automatically saved to a file (`laundry.txt`) to prevent loss.
